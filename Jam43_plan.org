* SQUAREDUDE AND CIRCLEGIRL
  The game is about our two protagonists: Squaredude and Circlegirl.
  The game plays as a parallax 3D puzzle platformer.
** STORY
   Circlegirl is trying to reach her hometown of Sphertopia. Along the
   way, she finds herself lost and stumbles upon a fellow traveler by
   the name of Squaredude. Squaredude is the son of the mayor of the
   nearby town Orthopolis, Quarteddy. Mayor Quarteddy has been
   kidnapped by the evil Icosaking, in an attempt to claim Orthopolis
   as his own. Circlegirl agrees to team up with Squaredude to stop
   the evil Icosaking.
** GAMEPLAY
   The game is an open world, though actual exploration is mostly
   linear. Though, to be clear, there are no /explicit/ level
   designators, just different rooms you travel between.

   The player initially controls Circlegirl. Upon meeting Squaredude,
   the player gains the ability to switch between the two of them. The
   two characters can exist in different rooms, and switching between
   them can transition to a different room.

   Both characters have the same basic movement set. They can walk in
   one of four directions on a grid. They can leap up half-block
   heights and fall one full block. Falling further results in death.

   The primary game mechanic is the elemental panels. There are four
   elemental panel types: fire, water, air, and thunder. When a
   character steps on an elemental panel, they gain the abilities of
   that element until they step on another panel. The abilities can
   generally be used by facing an object and pressing SPACEBAR.
   Circlegirl and Squaredude have the same abilities when it comes to
   elements.
*** DONE FIRE
    A fire character can start fires in front of them, which destroys
    wooden objects and lights torches. Passively, they can also pass
    through active flames, which would kill any non-fire character.

    If a fire character uses fire on their partner, the partner will
    be launched at high speed away from the fire character, at a speed
    high enough to destroy rocks.
*** DONE WATER
    A water character can spray water. Water causes plants to grow and
    can put out flames. +Water can also fill small holes, which will
    cause objects in those holes to float to the top.+

    If used on the partner, launches them higher into the air and
    allows them to land on a higher platform.
*** DONE AIR
    An air character can summon wind in front of them. Any crates will
    be launched when blown with wind. Air characters are passively
    immune to fall damage; they can fall arbitrary heights without
    taking damage.

    If an air character summons wind in front of their partner, their
    partner will fly in the given direction. During flight, they will
    not fall, even if there's no ground below them. They will continue
    flying until they hit something.
*** DONE THUNDER
    A thunder character can summon a lightning bolt in front of them.
    This will activate electronic devices in front of them. It also
    conducts through metal objects and activates electronic devices
    transitively in this way.

    If a thunder character summons thunder on their partner, their
    partner will be shocked and will move without changing direction.
    This effect continues until the partner uses an ability or jumps.
** FEATURES
*** DONE WOODEN BOX
    A wooden box can be pushed by a player. The player's strength is
    only able to push one box at a time. +Boxes can fill in holes.+
    Wooden boxes will burn if set on fire.
*** DONE METAL BOX
    A metal box is exactly like a wooden box, except that it is
    fireproof. Also, metal boxes conduct electricity.
*** DONE TORCH
    A torch can be set on fire. This usually activates or deactivates
    a mechanism somewhere.
*** DONE DEVICE
    Mechanism which toggles when hit with electricity.
*** DONE QUANTUM BLOCK
    A quantum block is a solid block that only exists when a character
    is looking at it. Specifically, it counts as air if there is no
    character facing toward it. If there is a character facing toward
    it, then it is solid. If there is something (or someone) in the
    way, it does not become solid. This mainly interacts with the
    partner-thunder ability, which changes the way someone faces.
*** +ICE+
    Ice causes players to slide. Using fire on it will melt it into
    water.
*** +ICOSASENTRY+
    This clever droid sits and waits until it sees someone
    horizontally or vertically aligned with it (on the same Z axis).
    If it does, it attacks and destroys them. It can't see through
    blocks, though.
*** DONE CRACKED ROCK
    A cracked rock, secured into the ground. Cannot be pushed, but can
    be destroyed if approached at high-speed (i.e. using partner-fire
    or by launching a block into it)
*** +SMALL BOULDER+
    A small boulder. Can be pushed like a crate. If the air ability is
    used on it, it will fly in one direction until it hits something.
*** +LARGE BOULDER+
    Like a small boulder but too heavy to be pushed on its own. Can
    only be moved with the air ability.
*** DONE PRESSURE PLATE
    Activates a mechanism if pressed down. Can be pressed with a box
    or a boulder.
*** DONE DOOR
    Activates based on a pressure plate, electronic switch, or other
    control mechanism.
*** DONE ELEMENTAL PANEL
    Switches the character who steps on it to the given element.
*** +WEATHER PANEL+
    Either a rain, sun, or snow panel. Causes that particular weather
    event.

    Sunny weather has no effect, but it clears all of the other
    weather. This is the default.

    Rainy weather puts out all fires, but it kills any fire characters
    in play.

    Snowy weather freezes any water into ice (this is a temporary
    freeze and will be undone when the snowstorm ends).
*** +SPRING PANEL+
    When leaving this tile, the player automatically jumps one tile.
*** +BOMB+
    Explodes when it falls or is set on fire. Kills anyone adjacent to
    it and breaks cracked blocks nearby (the same blocks a flaming
    player can run into)
*** DONE BURNING TILE
    Kills anyone who touches it, unless they have the fire ability.
    Also burns wooden objects that land on it.
*** DONE FLOWER
    Spray with water and it will grow into a platform
*** DONE SHAPED PANEL
    Either a square or a circle. If the wrong character touches it, they die.
